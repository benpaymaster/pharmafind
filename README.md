## Workflow: Build, Test, Push, Update

1. **Build New Features**

   - Develop smart contracts in `contracts/` (Solidity)
   - Implement backend APIs and AI services in `ai/`
   - Create and enhance frontend features in `frontend/`

2. **Test Features**

   - Run unit and integration tests for smart contracts (`tests/smart_contracts/`)
   - Test backend APIs and AI logic (`tests/ai/`)
   - Test frontend components and UI (`tests/frontend/`)

3. **Push Changes**

   - Commit all code and documentation updates
   - Push to GitHub for review and collaboration

4. **Update README**
   - Document new features, architecture decisions, and test coverage
   - Summarize alignment with GenLayer Labs' requirements

# GenLayer Labs Solidity & AI Integration Showcase

## Project Summary & Job Alignment

This project demonstrates expertise in decentralized application development, smart contract engineering, and AI-driven backend integration. It is designed as a real-world Dapp for pharmacy inventory and expiry management, leveraging Solidity smart contracts, scalable distributed systems, and secure coding practices. The architecture and workflow directly align with GenLayer Labs' mission to build trust infrastructure for the AI Age and support Optimistic Democracy consensus.

### Key Features & Alignment

- **Decentralized Inventory & Expiry Management:** Uses Solidity smart contracts (`PharmacyInventory.sol`, `PrescriptionNFT.sol`) for secure, transparent, and scalable data management.
- **AI-Driven Backend:** Integrates FastAPI and Python AI services for real-time location, expiry notifications, and automated decision support.
- **Scalable Distributed Systems:** Designed for multi-branch, multi-stakeholder use, with a focus on performance and reliability.
- **Secure, Gas-Efficient Contracts:** Follows best practices for Solidity security and gas optimization.
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests for both smart contracts and frontend/backend features.
- **Documentation & Collaboration:** Well-documented codebase, open to code review and team feedback.
